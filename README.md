Description
-----------

The plugin allows to add a widget to the profile page / dashboard that shows the latest site members who visited this profile page. If this visitor is currently online, the icon shown in the widget has a green border. Profile icons of friends (as long as they are not online) have a blue border.


REMARK TO AVAILABILITY OF THIS PLUGIN
-------------------------------------

Due to the licence (GPLv3) it's currently not possible to add this plugin to the Elgg community repository. I would have preferred for the original plugin to be released under GPLv2 and would have kept the licence unchanged when upgrading the plugin. But the GPLv3 can not be downgraded to GPL2.


Installation
------------

1. If you have a previous version of the iZAP Profile Visitors plugin installed, first remove the old izap_profile_visitors plugin folder from your mod directory before copying/extracting the new version to your server,
2. Copy the izap_profile_visitors folder in the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
3. Enable the plugin in the admin section,
4. The widget is available to be added to profile pages/dashboards.
